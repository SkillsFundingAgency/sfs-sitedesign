      <h2 class='heading-medium'>How these figures are calculated</h2>
      <h2 class='heading-small'>The funding the school actually receives may be different</h2>
      <p>These figures show what schools would receive if the national funding formula was followed exactly and pupil numbers from the October 2019 school census, or agreed pupil numbers from 2019, were used. The funding that schools actually receive may be different. This is because funds are allocated to the local authority first. The local authority then decides how much funding a school gets.</p>
      <h2 class='heading-small'>These figures use pupil numbers from 2019</h2>
      <p>These figures have been calculated based on pupil numbers from the October 2019 census (or agreed pupil numbers from a similar time). This was the most recent pupil number information available at the time the allocations were calculated. The school’s final funding allocation for 2021 to 2022 will be based on pupil numbers from 2020.     </p>
      <h2 class='heading-small'>Schools receive both pupil-led and school-led funding</h2>
      <p>Pupil-led funding is calculated based on the number of pupils in the school and their characteristics. Characteristics include factors such as how old the pupils are and whether they are from a disadvantaged background. School-led funding includes a lump sum for all schools and additional funding for schools with certain characteristics, such as being small and remote.</p>
      <p>The funding allocation and funding per pupil figures shown for a school are the total of both the school-led and the pupil-led funding. However, the figures showing the change in funding per pupil is calculated based on the school’s pupil-led funding only.    </p>
      <h2 class='heading-small'>What these allocation figures include </h2>
