                  <h2 class='heading-small'>The funding the school actually receives may be different</h2>
                  <p>These figures show what schools would recieve if the national funding formula was followed exactly and 2019 pupil numbers were used. The funding that schools actually receive may be different. This is because funds are allocated to the local authority first. The local authority then decided how much funding a school gets.</p>
                  <h2 class='heading-small'>Pupil numbers are two years old</h2>
                  <p>These figures use calculations based on 2019 pupil numbers. The final funding allocation will be based on pupil numbers from 2020.</p>
                  <h2 class='heading-small'>Why are pupil numbers calculated this way?</h2>
                  <p>At the time, the national funding formula information is prepared, the most recent pupil number information available is from the previous year's October census or agreed pupil numbers from a similar time. By the time the final funding statement is issued, more recent pupil numbers are available to prepare the final calculations.</p>
                  <h2 class='heading-small'>What these figures include</h2>
                  <p>Figures for 2020 to 2021 include the teacher pay grant and the teachers’ pension employer contribution grant. This ensures that the figures for 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 are comparable, since the funding from these grants has been added to the national funding formula allocations for 2021 to 2022.</p>
                  <h2 class='heading-small'>If a school isn’t open all year</h2>
                  <p>For schools that opened or will permanently close partway through the year, the funding allocation shown is the funding allocated for the school for the period it is open. The funding per pupil figure shows the amount that the school would have received for each pupil had it been open for the full year. </p>
