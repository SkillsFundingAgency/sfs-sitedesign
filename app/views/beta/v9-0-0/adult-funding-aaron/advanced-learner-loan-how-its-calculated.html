        <p>We have set your baseline using your approved, attended and paid loan applications in 2016 to 2017. If you meet our track-record criteria we have increased your baseline by 3%, otherwise you receive the baseline.</p>
        <p>We have then applied one of the following rules: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>if we awarded you growth at performance management point 1 or 2 of the 2017 to 2018 academic year, or your contract value did not change at these points, your facility will be the greater of your baseline or your post-performance management point 2 contract value. If we awarded you growth at performance management point 1 but then reduced your facility at performance management point 2, we will still apply this rule.</li>
            <li>if we reduced your contract value at performance management point 2 of the 2017 to 2018 academic year, your facility will be the lower of your baseline or your post performance management point 2 contract value.</li>
            <li>if you had no delivery recorded in 2016 to 2017 you will receive a minimum allocation of Â£5,000</li>
