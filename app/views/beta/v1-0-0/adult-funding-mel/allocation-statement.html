<p>March 2017</p>

    <p>Dear Colleague,</p>
        <p>
    I am writing to provide your allocation statement for the 2017 to 2018 funding year: it includes the allocations that
    are relevant to you. Please read it with the following documents: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-funding-letter-april-2017-to-march-2018" target="_blank"> skills funding letter 2017 to 2018</a> and our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sfa-funding-rules" target="_blank"> funding
    and performance management rules for the 2017 to 2018 year</a>.</p><p>
    Apprenticeships</p><p>
    Reforms to the apprenticeship system mean that providers will be able to earn apprenticeship funding through
    different routes. As a result of this, please note that your allocation statement does not include apprenticeship
    funding at this time. The following section of this letter sets out the reasons for this in more detail.
    New starts (starts from 1 May 2017)</p><p>
    You will earn funding for new apprenticeship starts through your delivery to levy paying employers and/or non-levy
    paying employers. Please note that any funding you secure for non-levy starts from 1 May is not included in your
    allocation statement as it is being communicated separately.</p><p>
    Carry-in learners (apprentices that start before 1 May 2017)
    We want to ensure that apprentices that start before 1 May 2017 (carry-in learners) are funded until the end of their
    programmes. We will allocate funding in future years (2017 to 2018 and beyond) to meet the cost of these
    apprentices.</p><p>
    In early February 2017, we published updated apprenticeship performance management rules for the 2016 to 2017
    funding year . These rules set out our commitment to fund carry-in learners ‘reflecting funding previously paid by the
    Skills Funding Agency’. The next section of the letter explains how we will work out your carry-in allocation.
</p><p>
    Adult education budget</p><p>
    Where applicable, funding will be allocated beyond 2017 to 2018 to ensure apprentices that started before 1 May
    2017 can complete their programmes.</p><p>
    all apprentices achieve on their planned end date and draw down their achievement payment on this date
    Allocations for carry-in learners for 2017 to 2018</p><p>
    We will work out the value of your 2017 to 2018 carry-in allocation in June, based on your R10 data return.
    Calculating your carry-in allocation in June will enable us to work your allocation out on the basis of your actual
    delivery, rather than us trying to forecast your activity to issue your allocation earlier. We have consulted on this
    with the Association of Colleges, Association of Employment and Learning Providers and our Provider Reference
    Group.</p><p>
    We encourage you to submit full and timely data at R10 as this will improve the accuracy of the carry-in allocation
    we work out for you. We will confirm your carry-in allocation for the 2017 to 2018 funding year in July 2017.
    The methodology we will use to work out your carry-in will be based on your actual data at R10 and the following
    assumptions:
    there is no drop-out</p><p>
    for Trailblazer Standards incentive payments will be drawn down on the date they are due
    an allowance for data lag.</p><p>
    We continue to allocate your adult education budget as a block grant. We have set the baseline for your 2017 to
    2018 allocation at the level of your 2016 to 2017 contract value as at January 2017. It includes the value of any
    traineeship growth you were awarded at performance management point 1 of the 2016 to 2017 funding year. Where
    applicable to you, it also includes community learning funding.
    Your allocation statement does not include any funds you may be awarded through the adult education budget
    procurement that closed on 27 February. If you submitted a bid, we will notify you of the outcome in May. Funding
    awarded through the procurement is for the 2017 to 2018 funding year and will not automatically be consolidated in
    future baselines.</p><p>
    all apprentices remain on programme until their planned end date and draw down all on-programme
    payments due. Note that for Trailblazer Standards we will first convert any remaining balance to be paid
    into on-programme payments</p><p>
    Please note that if you only deliver apprenticeships, for the reasons given above, you will not have an allocation
    statement attached to this letter.
</p><p>

    Continuing learners
    Future devolution of the adult education budget
    We continue to work with ministers and other stakeholders on the proposals to devolve adult education budget
    funding to areas with agreed devolution deals. Your 2017 to 2018 adult education budget allocation is not affected
    by devolution plans.</p><p>
    If you wish to discuss your allocation statement, please contact your provider manager.<br>
    Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>
    In 2017 to 2018, loans provision can no longer be sub-contracted. If you have significant levels of sub-contracting,
    our provider management team will have contacted you to discuss how you intend to transition from using sub-
    contractors.</p><p>
    Your loans bursary allocation has been worked out using your latest 2016 to 2017 contract value.
    Director – Funding and Programmes
    We have set the baseline for your 2017 to 2018 loan facility at the same level as your latest 2016 to 2017 facility
    value (as at February 2017).</p><p>
    If this applies to you, your allocation statement shows a negative funding value for ‘19+ continuing learners’. Your
    allocation statement from the EFA will show a corresponding positive funding value for these learners. Please note
    that if you are a Sixth Form College, your allocation statement will not show a value for continuing learners as EFA
    already fund your continuing learners until the end of their programmes.
    Advanced learner loan facility and bursary
    In the past, learners that started a programme aged 16 to 18 but turned 19 during their programme moved from
    being funded by the Education Funding Agency (EFA) to the Skills Funding Agency (SFA). This has been a
    complex arrangement and one we are simplifying for the 2017 to 2018 funding year. We have transferred funding to
    EFA at a national level to cover the cost of these ‘continuing learners’ that we currently fund. This means that the
    EFA will now fund these learners until the end of their programmes. This was communicated in December 2016 .
</p><p>
    Should you wish to raise any queries on your statement, please do so through your provider management contact. If, due to an exceptional
    circumstance only, you want to raise an issue with the values on your allocation statement, the deadline for submitting a case is 5 May
    2017. We will not consider any requests after this date. We expect to review all cases in May and June 2017 and share outcomes by the
    end of July 2017.</p>-->
