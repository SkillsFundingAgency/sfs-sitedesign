<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This operational guide helps you understand how the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) has calculated your 2020 to 2021 academic year funding. We have developed the guide in consultation with a sample of academies to make sure it meets your needs.</p>

<p>The guide supports your general annual grant (GAG) statement. It sets out the funding you will receive, how we have calculated it, the factors that have been applied and the source of the data we use. You will notice some changes to some of the tables, but we have kept these to a minimum to allow headline year-on-year comparisons.
For 2020 to 2021, weâ€™ll continue to use the national funding formula (NFF) for schools, high needs and central school services, to allocate budgets to local authorities.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the NFF school-level allocations that we published in October 2019 in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">spreadsheet format</a> and then in a new <a rel="external" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/national-funding-formula/2020-2021/start" class="govuk-link">on-line tool</a> in January 2020, were notional allocations only.</p>

<p>In 2020 to 2021, local authorities have continued to set a local formula which has determined individual school and academy budgets in their authority. As in previous years, local authorities have submitted this local formula to us so that we can produce and issue academies allocation statements. Your GAG statement reflects the local formula.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-guide">How to use the guide</h2>

<p>We have produced the guide in a format that allows you to easily access the specific parts that interest you, or areas where you require more detailed information.</p>

<p>The Whatâ€™s new?â€™ section shows the changes to academy funding in the 2020 to 2021 academic year at a glance, and where the change is reflected in your GAG statement. The subsequent chapters take you through an example funding statement table by table, explaining each line in turn.</p>

<p>We recognise that GAG funding makes up only part of the overall funding for your academy. The section at the end of the guide lists the main non-GAG revenue and capital funding lines. It includes links to information about how and when these are paid.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-the-guide-for">Who is the guide for?</h2>

<p>This guide is for mainstream academies and free schools (including studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs)) open before 1 April 2020, including those with designated special units and resourced provision. Separate guidance is available for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">special and alternative provision academies.</a></p>

<p>When we refer to academies in this document we are referring to all types, including free schools, UTCs and studio schools, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h2 id="further-information">Further information</h2>

<p>Further information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funding-allocations" class="govuk-link">academy revenue funding allocations</a> is available.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-the-2020-to-2021-academic-year">Whatâ€™s new in the 2020 to 2021 academic year?</h2>

<p>The changes to funding in 2020 to 2021 are summarised below and you can find more information on the technical aspects of these in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>Further policy information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-16-schools-funding-local-authority-guidance-for-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">pre-16 schools funding arrangements for 2020 to 2021</a> is also available. This includes the operational guidance on schools revenue funding which sets out the factors that local authorities can use in their funding formula. We have also published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">high needs funding arrangements for 2020 to 2021</a>.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-funding-formula-and-your-gag-statement">Changes to the funding formula and your GAG statement</h3>

<p>The key changes to the funding methodology for 2020 to 2021 are set out below. It is important to note that local authorities have some flexibility about how they reflect these changes in their local formula, so you may not see these reflected in your GAG statement.</p>

<h3 id="sixth-form-funding">Sixth form funding</h3>

<p>On 31 August 2019, the Chancellor announced an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-400-million-investment-for-16-19-year-olds-education" class="govuk-link">additional Â£400m </a>for 16 to 19 education for academic year 2020 to 2021. We have published information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-information-for-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">what this means for 16 to 19 revenue funding allocations in 2020 to 2021</a> and will continue to update our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 funding allocations</a> page and timeline with further information as it becomes available.</p>

<p>The summary table will present an extract from your 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation statement (which we upload to Document Exchange separately) as shown in section 3 of the sample table above.
Further information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 funding allocations</a>including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">guidance</a> to help you understand your allocation is also available.</p>

<h2 id="school-budget-share">School budget share</h2>
<p>Table A sets out how we calculate your school budget share (SBS). Your local authority agrees funding factors and rates in consultation with its schools forum and supplies these to ESFA using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/authority-proforma-tool-apt-information-for-local-authorities." class="govuk-link">local authority pro forma tool.</a>We apply these to your academy pupil numbers.</p>

<p>We do not make a deduction to your SBS pupil numbers for high needs places. Instead, we determine the SBS based on the total number of pupils on roll, including those in the special unit or resourced provision.</p>

<h3 id="factor">Factor (label not used in prototype - suggest rehoming content under other headings like basic entitlement, total pupil-led factors etc)</h3>
<p>This column shows the names of the factors through which the local authority can allocate funding. There are three mandatory factors that all local authorities must use in their funding formula: basic entitlement age weighted pupil unit (AWPU), deprivation and minimum per pupil funding levels (MPPFL). All other factors are optional.</p>

<p>Factors are labelled as either pupil-led or non-pupil-led. Pupil-led factors are driven by pupil numbers and pupil characteristics. Across all the schools in the local authority as a whole, at least 80% of schools block funding must flow through pupil-led factors. This may not be the case for every individual school, however.</p>

<p>Non-pupil-led factors could include lump sum, split site funding, private finance initiative (PFI) and exceptional circumstances. The exceptional circumstances lines will only appear on your statement if your local authority has ESFA agreement that it can apply exceptional factors and these are applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3 id="rate">Rate</h3>
<p>This shows the rate paid for a particular factor. This is taken from your local authorityâ€™s proforma tool. If your local authority does not include a particular factor in its funding formula the rate will show as Â£0.00.</p>

<h3 id="weighting">Weighting</h3>
<p>This shows the proportion of pupils attracting funding under a particular factor. For example, if the rate is Â£1,000 and the weighting is 1.0 this means that Â£1,000 is applied to 100% of your pupil number shown in the next column. If the weighting is 0.50, the rate only applies to 50% of your pupil number.</p>

<h3 id="sub-total">Sub-total</h3>
<p>This is the rate multiplied by the weighting multiplied by pupil numbers, and shows the funding payable for that factor. If your local authority does not include a factor in its funding formula the sub-total will be Â£0.00.</p>

<h3 id="total-pupil-led-factors">Total pupil-led factors</h3>
<p>This shows the total of all the pupil-led factors applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3 id="total-other-factors">Total other factors</h3>
<p>This shows the total of all the non-pupil-led factors applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3 id="total-school-budget-share">Total school budget share</h3>
<p>This is the sum of your pupil-led factors and non-pupil-led factors (excluding rates but including any applicable MPPFL uplift).</p>

<h3 id="notional-sen">Notional SEN</h3>
<p>Local authorities will have identified a notional special educational needs (SEN) budget in each school budget share. This is called notional because it is not a ring-fenced budget, and academies can make their own decisions about how much to spend on SEN support given the needs of their pupils.</p>

<p>When planning their budgets, academies should take into account that they must meet the costs of additional support for pupils with SEN up to Â£6,000 from their school budget share (including the notional SEN funding).</p>

<p>The total notional SEN budget is made up of a proportion of various factors included in your school budget share, depending on the local formula. The factors included and the proportion attributed to your notional SEN budget allocation is decided locally.</p>

<h3 id="funding-dedelegated-to-local-authority">Funding de-delegated to local authority</h3>
<p>Funding for services is delegated by local
  authorities to schools through the funding formula. Maintained schools collectively may then pass back, or de-delegate, funding to the local authority for certain services to be provided centrally, with the approval of the schools forum...</p>


<h2 id="basic-entitlement">Basic entitlement</h2>
<p>For 2021 to 2022, the basic entitlement for primary and secondary pupils are Â£2,000 and Â£3,000 respectively.</p>

<p>The local authority can set different unit values for key stage 3 (KS3) and key stage 4 (KS4) but each of these must be at least Â£3,000 per pupil.</p>

<p>Local authorities also have the option to apply a reception uplift, for example to add new reception pupils starting between the autumn 2019 and January 2020 census.</p>

<h3 id="pupil-numbers">Pupil numbers</h3>
<p>Pupil numbers are derived either from your autumn 2019 validated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complete-the-school-census" class="govuk-link">school census</a> return or your agreed estimate of pupil numbers for the 2020 to 2021 academic year, depending on the terms of your funding agreement.</p>

<p>If the pupil numbers are derived from the census, ESFA only includes pupils who are current pupils with a single or dual registration at the school. Pupils with the following enrolment statuses are not included:</p>

<p>S - current subsidiary with dual registration 
G - pupil not registered at the school but attending some lessons or sessions</p>

<p>However, where the local authority notifies us of variations in school census numbers (through their authority proforma tool, for planned growth or infrastructure changes) then these will be used to calculate your allocation.</p>

<h2 id="deprivation">Deprivation</h2>
<p>Your local authority formula can use any combination of IDACI categories and/or free school meals data to allocate its deprivation funding.</p>

<h3 id="idaci-bands">IDACI bands</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015" class="govuk-link">Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI)</a> measures the proportion of children under the age of 16 that live in low-income households based on their postcode.</p>

<p>A separate rate can be paid for each of the six categories in the IDACI index, and for the primary and secondary phases.</p>

<h3 id="free-school-meals">Free school meals</h3>
<p>The number of children in your academy eligible for free school meals from 2021 to 2022 are recorded in the autumn 2020 school census.</p>

<h3 id="free-school-meals-children-eligible-during-past-6-years">Free school meals: children eligible during past 6 years</h3>
<p>The number of these children are produced by mapping the pupil premium 2019 to 2020 dataset onto the spring 2020 census.</p>

<h2 id="children-looked-after">Children looked-after</h2>
<p>The term â€˜looked-afterâ€™ refers to children under 18 who have been provided with care and accommodation by childrenâ€™s services.</p>

<p>Pupil numbers use information collected from the local authority mapped to the spring school census. It covers all children who have been looked after for a day or more to 31 March 2020.</p>

<h2 id="prior-attainment">Prior attainment</h2>

<h3 id="primary">Primary</h3>
<p>This factor may be applied for primary pupils identified as not achieving the expected level of development within the early years foundation stage profile (EYFSP).</p>

<p>The EYFSP changed in 2013, so from 2020 to 2021 there will be no need for a primary weighting as all primary year groups will represent results under the new framework.</p>

<h3 id="secondary">Secondary</h3>
<p>For secondary pupils, prior attainment funding can be targeted at pupils not achieving the expected standard in KS2 in either reading, writing or maths.</p>

<p>A national weighting will be applied to year 7. Year 8, 9 and 10 pupils will have a fixed weighting. Secondary prior attainment for pupils in year 11 will continue to be calculated without a weighting to reflect that these pupils took the old style KS2 tests.</p>

<h2 id="english-as-an-additional-language">English as an additional language</h2>
<p>Ipsom Lorem</p>

<h2 id="sparsity">Sparsity</h2>
<p>The sparsity factor is derived from the distance that pupils live from their second nearest eligible school. </p>

<h3 id="secondary">How distance is calculated</h3>
<p>For each school, those pupils for whom the school is the closest eligible school are identified and then the average distance to the second nearest eligible school for these pupils is calculated. Distances are calculated using the crow flies distance from a pupilâ€™s postcode to a schoolâ€™s postcode. This has been calculated using pupil and school postcode coordinates from the autumn pupil level
and school level census. </p>
<p>For the purposes of this factor, selective grammar schools are not considered when identifying the second nearest school. In addition, pupils living outside of England are excluded from the sparsity distance calculations.</p>
<p>The school size criteria in the sparsity calculation is based on average year group. </p>
<h3 id="secondary">How to work out eligibility</h3>
<p>A school may attract sparsity funding if it meets the following criteria:</p>

<p>Insert table</p>

<p>Local authorities can narrow the eligibility criteria by increasing the average distance to the second nearest school or reducing the pupil number thresholds. They may not widen the eligibility criteria. Local authorities can determine a sparsity lump sum for each of the above phases, up to a maximum of Â£100,000 per academy in each case.</p>

<p>They can also use a â€˜taperâ€™ so that the amount paid to an institution is relative to their pupil numbers. This means the smallest schools receive higher sparsity funding. </p>
<p>Local authorities can apply the NFF methodology which gives the lump sum to the
smallest schools and then applies a taper for those with an average year group size
greater than 50% of the threshold.</p>


<h2 id="minimum-per-pupil-funding-level">Minimum per pupil funding level</h2>
<p>The national funding formula (NFF) provides a minimum per pupil funding value when setting the funding levels for local authorities. These minimum per pupil values have increased for 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>The calculation of the minimum per pupil funding rate has been simplified to ensure consistency for all schools, including those with non-standard year groups. The use of the minimum per pupil rate has also been made mandatory, though, in certain circumstances, LAs can apply to change the rate(s) through the â€˜disapplicationâ€™ process.</p>

<p>The calculation of the â€˜testâ€™ for any uplift for the minimum per pupil funding has been simplified; the option for the local authority to exclude elements of funding has been removed so that now mobility is always included in the calculation and premises (rates, PFI, split sites for example) always excluded.</p>

<p>To ensure consistency for all schools, including those with non-standard year groups, this year we have simplified the calculation for a schoolâ€™s individual minimum per-pupil levels within the NFF.</p>

<p>For all schools, we will now apply the following calculation:</p>

<p>((Number of primary year groups R â€“ Y6 Ã— Â£3,750) + (Number of KS3 year groups Y7 â€“ Y9 Ã— Â£4,800) + (Number of KS4 year groups Y10 &amp; Y11 Ã— Â£5,300))</p>

<p>divided by Total number of year groups</p>

<p>This calculation will provide per-pupil funding of at least Â£3,750 for each primary school, and Â£5,000 for each secondary school with standard structures of seven and five year groups respectively.</p>

<p>For middle schools, all-through schools and other schools with a non-standard year group structure this will produce a specific minimum per-pupil value that relates to the number of year groups in each phase.</p>

<p>The total academy SBS allocation (excluding any prior year adjustment) is divided by the funded number on roll (NOR) (reception to year 11) to arrive at the per pupil allocation for comparing with the minimum per pupil funding level. We do not include the rates figure in the calculation for academies as we pay academies separately for national non-domestic rates (NNDR) using the online claim form.</p>

<p>If the academyâ€™s per pupil allocation is higher than the minimum per pupil rate set by the local authority the minimum per pupil funding level allocation is zero. Otherwise, the minimum per pupil funding level allocation is calculated as the minimum per pupil level rate, less the per pupil allocation, multiplied by NOR.</p>

<p>Where an academy receives a minimum per pupil funding level allocation, they will be exempt from capping and scaling in the minimum funding guarantee (MFG) 24 calculation. Similarly, where they do not receive a minimum funding level allocation, capping and scaling will not take the budget lower than the minimum per pupil funding level.</p>



<h2 id="minimum-funding-guarantee">Minimum funding guarantee</h2>
<p>The minimum funding guarantee is a protection against changes in per pupil school budget share (SBS) funding between the 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 academic years.</p>

<p>The amount of protection will vary according to the impact of local changes in the funding formula and the effect of these on individual per pupil rates. In 2020 to 2021, local authorities have the flexibility to set local MFG between -1.5% and +1.84% per pupil in order to offer higher levels of protection locally.</p>

<p>To determine whether to apply the MFG we calculate and compare the MFG per pupil values for the two years. If there is a positive change in per pupil funding of more than the rate set by the local authority, the change is capped at this rate.</p>

<p>As the MFG calculation operates at a per pupil level, not on the overall SBS, we do not protect falling budgets caused by a reduction in pupil numbers.</p>

<p>MFG is not calculated for special and alternative provision academies, as these are funded for the number of agreed high needs places.</p>

<p>MFG applies to pupils in reception to year 11, excluding any reception uplift if it is applied by the local authority.</p>

<h3 id="academies-that-opened-in-year">Academies that opened in-year</h3>
<p>This is the calculation made by the local authority for the whole 2021 to 2022 financial year. If a local authority has applied capping or scaling then this would appear as a deduction.</p>

<p>Minimum funding guarantee is proportioned for the number of days your academy is open between 1 September 2020 and the end of the academic year, 31 August 2021.</p>

<p>For academies opening before or on 1 September 2020 this will be equivalent to the full year amount.</p>

<h3 id="existing-academies">Existing academies</h3>

<h4 id="full-year-school-budget-share">School budget share</h4>
<p>This is the actual school budget share paid excluding rates and post-16 funding but including any minimum funding guarantee and capping/scaling applied.</p>

<p>This is a full year funding amount. Any part-year openers will have their funding grossed up to a full year allocation.</p>

<h4 id="lump-sum-2021-to-2022">Lump sum 2021 to 2022</h4>
<p>The lump sum for the 2021 to 2022 academic year is removed from the school budget share in both funding years to allow for a year-on-year comparison of per pupil funding.</p>

<p>This is because some authorities will have a different lump sum between the 2 years, and excluding different amounts in each of those years would distort (either excessively or inadequately) the protection that minimum funding guarantee provides.</p>

<h4 id="sparsity-2021-to-2022">Sparsity 2021 to 2022</h4>
<p>The sparsity value for the 2021 to 2022 academic year is removed from the school budget share in both funding years to allow for a year-on-year comparison of per pupil funding.</p>

<p>This is because sparsity is similar to the lump sum in its purpose and therefore not excluding it would distort the protection that minimum funding guarantee provides.</p>

<h4 id="approved-exclusions">Approved exclusions</h4>
<p>Local authorities are able to apply to ESFA for specific funding elements to be excluded from the minimum funding guarantee.</p>

<h4 id="technical-adjustments-set-by-local-authority">Technical adjustments set by local authority</h4>
<p>This will show any further adjustments made to cover any additional circumstances needed to make the baseline for 2020 to 2021 comparable with 2021 to 2022 funding.</p>

<p>Ipsom Lorumâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="start-up-grant-for-new-sponsored-academy">Start-up grant for new sponsored academy</h2>
<p>There are two elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a flat rate allocation that is paid in the first year of opening</li>
  <li>a formulaic allocation that is intended to contribute to costs, such as leadership, as a new academy grows towards full capacity</li>
</ul>

<p>The formulaic allocation is paid over 2 years for primary schools and 3 years for secondary schools.</p>

<p>The calculations for both elements are different for primary and secondary, and for special and alternative provision academies. More information is available in sponsored academies funding: advice for sponsors.</p>

<h2 id="high-needs-funding">High needs funding</h2>
<p>This section will only be populated for those mainstream academies that have designated special units or resourced provision.</p>

<h3 id="mainstream-academies-free-schools-studio-schools-and-utcs">Mainstream academies, free schools, studio schools and UTCs</h3>

<h4 id="rate-for-occupied-and-unoccupied-places">Rate for occupied and unoccupied places</h4>
<p>In 2021 to 2022, pre-16 places at special units/resourced provision occupied by pupils recorded on the school census as sole or dual (main) will be funded at Â£6,000. Pupils in these places will also attract funding through the mainstream school formula.</p>

<p>Other places are funded at Â£10,000. This may apply where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the place is or will be occupied by a pupil registered on the roll of another school</li>
  <li>a place isnâ€™t occupied at the time of the school census count, but is likely to be filled, and requires funding</li>
  <li>spare capacity is required for another reason</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="place-numbers">Place numbers</h4>
<p>Local authorities request high needs places from ESFA as part of the annual place change notification process. This provides a base level of funding.</p>

<p>You must agree any additional funding above this level (top-up) with your commissioning local authority. Top-up funding is paid by the local authority and is therefore not shown on your GAG funding statement.</p>

<p>Further information on high needs funding arrangements for 2020 to 2021 is available.</p>

<h3 id="special-and-alternative-provision-academies-and-special-free-schools">Special and alternative provision academies and special free schools</h3>
<p>Local authorities have a role in funding high needs pupils in academies, as a commissioner of special education provision for these pupils. This means that academies receive funding for pupils with high needs from both ESFA (place funding) and local authorities (top-up funding). In the case of alternative provision (AP) the top-up funding can also come directly from other schools, where they commission places directly. More information about the role of the local authority in agreeing and commissioning high needs places is available in high needs funding arrangements for 2020 to 2021.</p>

<h4 id="place-numbers-1">Place numbers</h4>
<p>High needs funding for both pre-16 and 16 to 19 special educational needs (SEN) is funded on the number of agreed places.</p>

<p>AP (which by definition is pre-16 only) is also funded on a per place basis. 16 to 19 students at AP academies are funded per pupil at the national 16 to 19 funding formula rate. There may also be some 16 to 19 SEN places at AP academies which are funded on a per place basis.

We have developed the guide in consultation with a sample of academies to make sure it meets your needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide supports your general annual grant (GAG) statement. It sets out the funding you will receive, how we have calculated it, the factors that have been applied and the source of the data we use. You will notice some changes to some of the tables, but we have kept these to a minimum to allow headline year-on-year comparisons.\nFor 2020 to 2021, weâ€™ll continue to use the national funding formula (NFF) for schools, high needs and central school services, to allocate budgets to local authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to note that the NFF school-level allocations that we published in October 2019 in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2020-to-2021\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003espreadsheet format\u003c/a\u003e and then in a new \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/national-funding-formula/2020-2021/start\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eon-line tool\u003c/a\u003e in January 2020, were notional allocations only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2020 to 2021, local authorities have continued to set a local formula which has determined individual school and academy budgets in their authority. As in previous years, local authorities have submitted this local formula to us so that we can produce and issue academies allocation statements. Your GAG statement reflects the local formula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-use-the-guide\"\u003eHow to use the guide\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have produced the guide in a format that allows you to easily access the specific parts that interest you, or areas where you require more detailed information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Whatâ€™s new?â€™ section shows the changes to academy funding in the 2020 to 2021 academic year at a glance, and where the change is reflected in your GAG statement. The subsequent chapters take you through an example funding statement table by table, explaining each line in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recognise that GAG funding makes up only part of the overall funding for your academy. The section at the end of the guide lists the main non-GAG revenue and capital funding lines. It includes links to information about how and when these are paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-is-the-guide-for\"\u003eWho is the guide for?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide is for mainstream academies and free schools (including studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs)) open before 1 April 2020, including those with designated special units and resourced provision.
