<p>Schools receive <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport premium funding based on the number of pupils in years 1 to 6.</p>

<p>In cases where schools don't follow year groups (for example, in some special schools), pupils aged 5 to 10 attract the funding.</p>

<p>In most cases, we determine how many pupils in your school attract the funding using data from the January 2018 school census.</p>

<p>If you are a new school or a school teaching eligible pupils for the first time in the academic year 2018 to 2019, we will base your funding on data from the autumn 2018 school census.</p>

<h2 id="funding-for-2018-to-2019">Funding for 2018 to 2019</h2>

<p>Schools with 16 or fewer eligible pupils receive &pound;1,000 per pupil.</p>

<p>Schools with 17 or more eligible pupils receive &pound;16,000 and an additional payment of &pound;10 per pupil.</p>

<p>Maintained schools, including <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> and general hospitals, do not receive funding directly from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>. We give the funding to your local authority and they pass it on to you.</p>

<p>We give local authorities <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport premium funding for maintained schools in 2 separate payments. Local authorities receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7/12 of your funding allocation on 31 October 2018</li>
  <li>5/12 of your funding allocation on 30 April 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a new maintained school or if you are teaching eligible pupils for the first time in the academic year 2018 to 2019, local authorities receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7/12 of your funding allocation on 31 January 2019</li>
  <li>5/12 of your funding allocation on 30 April 2019</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="academies-free-schools-and-ctcs">Academies, free schools and <abbr title="city technology colleges">CTCs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The Education Skills and Funding Agency (ESFA) sends academies, free schools and <abbr title="city technology colleges">CTCs</abbr> their <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport premium funding in 2 separate payments. You receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7/12 of your funding allocation on 1 November 2018</li>
  <li>5/12 of your funding allocation on 1 May 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a new academy, free school or <abbr title="city technology college">CTC</abbr>, or if you are teaching eligible pupils for the first time in the academic year 2018 to 2019, you receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7/12 of your total funding allocation on 1 February 2019</li>
  <li>5/12 of your total funding allocation on 1 May 2019</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-maintained-special-schools">Non-maintained special schools</h3>

<p>ESFA sends non-maintained special schools their <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport premium funding in 2 separate payments. You receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7/12 of your funding with the first payment you have scheduled with ESFA after 1 November 2018</li>
  <li>5/12 of your funding with the first payment you have scheduled with ESFA after 1 May 2019</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-pe-and-sport-premium">How to use the <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport premium</h2>

<p>Schools must use the funding to make additional and sustainable improvements to the quality of <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport you offer.</p>

<p>This means that you should use the premium to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop or add to the <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport  activities that your school already offers</li>
  <li>build capacity and capability within the school to ensure that improvements made now will benefit pupils joining the school in future years</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 5 key indicators that schools should expect to see improvement across:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the engagement of all pupils in regular physical activity - the Chief Medical Officer guidelines recommend that all children and young people aged 5 to 18 engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity a day, of which 30 minutes should be in school</li>
  <li>the profile of <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport is raised across the school as a tool for whole-school improvement</li>
  <li>increased confidence, knowledge and skills of all staff in teaching <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport</li>
  <li>broader experience of a range of sports and activities offered to all pupils</li>
  <li>increased participation in competitive sport</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you can use your funding to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide staff with professional development, mentoring, training and resources to help them teach <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport more effectively</li>
  <li>hire qualified sports coaches to work with teachers to enhance or extend current opportunities</li>
  <li>introduce new sports, dance or other activities to encourage more pupils to take up sport and physical activities</li>
  <li>support and involve the least active children by providing targeted activities, and running or extending school sports and holiday clubs</li>
  <li>enter or run more sport competitions</li>
  <li>partner with other schools to run sports activities and clubs</li>
  <li>increase pupils' participation in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/getting-more-people-playing-sport/supporting-pages/the-school-games">School Games</a>
</li>
  <li>encourage pupils to take on leadership or volunteer roles that support sport and physical activity within the school</li>
  <li>provide additional swimming provision targeted to pupils not able to meet the swimming requirements of the national curriculum</li>
  <li>embed physical activity into the school day through active travel to and from school, active playgrounds and active teaching</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not use your funding to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employ coaches or specialist teachers to cover planning preparation and assessment (PPA) arrangements - these should come out of your core staffing budgets</li>
  <li>teach the minimum requirements of  the national curriculum - including those specified for swimming (or, in the case of academies and free schools, to teach your existing <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> curriculum)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="accountability">Accountability</h2>

<h3 id="ofsted-inspections">Ofsted inspections</h3>

<p>Ofsted assesses how primary schools use the primary <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport premium. They measure its impact on pupil outcomes, and how effectively governors hold school leaders to account for this.</p>

<p>You can find details of what inspectors look for in the 'effectiveness of leadership and management' section of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-from-september-2015">'Ofsted schools inspection handbook 2015'</a>.</p>

<h3 id="online-reporting">Online reporting</h3>

<p>You must publish details of how you spend your <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport premium funding. This must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of premium received</li>
  <li>a full breakdown of how it has been spent (or will be spent)</li>
  <li>the impact the school has seen on pupils' <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport participation and attainment</li>
  <li>how the improvements will be sustainable in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>For the 2018 to 2019 academic year, there is a new condition requiring schools to publish how many pupils within their year 6 cohort are meeting the national curriculum requirement to swim competently, confidently and proficiently over a distance of at least 25 metres, use a range of strokes effectively and perform safe self-rescue in different water-based situations.</p>

<p>This condition has been added in response to recommendations from the Swim Group, who reviewed curriculum swimming and water safety in primary schools. You can get <a rel="external" href="http://www.swimming.org/schoolswimming/using-pe-and-sports-premium/">advice and resources to help deliver swimming lessons successfully in primary schools</a>.</p>

<p>To help you plan, monitor and report on the impact of your spending, it's recommended that you download a template to record your activity. The Department has commissioned partners in the physical education and school sport sector to develop a template, which is available at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.afpe.org.uk/physical-education/evidencing-the-impact-guidance-template/">The Association for <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/primary-pe-and-sport-premium">Youth Sport Trust</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accountability-reviews">Accountability reviews</h3>
<p>Accountability reviews will be carried out after the April deadline for schools to have published details on their websites of how they have spent their premium funding. We will sample a number of schools in each local authority, with the schools chosen based on a mix of random selection and prior non-compliance with the online reporting requirements.</p>

<h3 id="further-advice">Further advice</h3>
<p>You can get further advice, including best practice examples of how schools are using their premium effectively, on the <a rel="external" href="https://teaching.blog.gov.uk/category/pe-and-sport-premium/">gov.uk teacher blog</a>.</p>
